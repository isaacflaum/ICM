# ICM
index.js is an ICM calculator for 6max poker games in which 2 places are paid.
I use the MH algorithm to calculate respective probabilities of coming in first 
and then use those probabilities to calculate the probabilities for each player
a of coming in second place. This is the summation of the probabilities that player a
wins an exclusive tournament (without the 1st place player) for each opponent coming
in first place.
